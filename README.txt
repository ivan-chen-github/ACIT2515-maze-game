Maze Game - tentative title

Project Background:
This project involves programming a maze-like game using Python and Pygame. The game focuses on
a player controlled sprite (using arrow keys) which can navigate the maze to collect items and 
reach the goal. The maze structure is generated from a text file and items are randomly placed 
on empty coordinates within the maze. The player wins by reaching the goal (symbolized by the heart 
item in the maze) and can gain extra points by collecting the items on the way.
